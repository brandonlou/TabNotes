# TabNotes
Make your new tabs more productive. You can write your agenda, jot down websites to read, or even write your own memoir on here.

It saves automatically locally to your web browser!

To use, download this repo. Then on Chrome, navigate to Settings --> Extentions. Check developer mode. Load an unpacked extension, select the folder, and there you have it.

Just in case, it's recommended to enable this extension in incognito ;)
